A reinforcement learning project titled:

Comparison of deep learning reinforcement methods when learning rules in a custom environment

Missions of this project:

- Learn more about reinforcement learning in a novel way, using a custom learning environment (trumps game)

- Test the limitations of deep reinforcement algorithms when using simple architecture

- Provide well documented, pep 8 obeying, example implementations of said algorithms for others to potentially learn from

All 3 goals have been met, and it was a sucessful project (with, of course, unlimited scope to keep improving).

Technologies used: Python, numpy, Pytorch, Jupyter, Objected orientated programming (OOP), Deep learning, Reinforcement Learning, Neural Networks,
