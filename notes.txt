mission of this project was two fold (hehe)

-- Learn more about reinforcement learning in a novel way, using a custom learning enviroment (trumps game)
-- test the limitaitons of deep reinforcement algoritihms when using simple architecture
-- provide well documented, pep 8 obeying, example implementations of said algorithims for others to potentially learn from

All 3 goals have been met, and it was a sucessful project (with, of course, unlimited scope to keep improving).

The full repository is on my github, along with a Ipython Jupyter Notebook  and a pdf paper, both giving a brief summary of the project and key results.

Technologies used: Python, numpy, Pytorch, Jupyter, Objected orientated programming (OOP), Deep learning, Reinforcement Learning, Neural Networks,
